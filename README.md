# Whiteboard of Thought

Whiteboard of Thought is a Python-based project based on the good work done here:https://whiteboard.cs.columbia.edu/. This project is designed to leverage advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to identify and analyze visual data. I'm not associated with Columbia University and have probably not done the project justice. But I found the experience fun and elightening.
This project is particularly focused on identifying specific characters or symbols from images, which can be useful in various applications such as digital document analysis and educational tools.

## Features

- **Image Processing**: Utilize Python libraries to process and analyze image data.
- **Character Recognition**: Special focus on identifying the letter 'q' from images using machine learning models.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily extendable to include more characters or symbols.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. This project uses Python 3.8 or above. You will also need pip to install the dependencies.

### Installation
